#!/bin/bash
# Wrapper for launching Inkscape.
#
# This wrapper does three things:
#
# 1. Keep all the paths and flags in one place.
#
#    We could have just embedded these inside the Makefile, but it's cleaner
#    to keep them here.
#
# 2. Cache output.
#
#    For every input SVG, cache the output PNG using the hash of the SVG
#    contents as the key.  If we see the same hash again, we can just copy
#    the PNG output from earlier, without having to run Inkscape again.
#
#    We do this because most of our images are generated from a single
#    master SVG that is split into multiple layers.  Changes to any single
#    layer will not affect the rasterized output the other layers, but the
#    timestamps of other layers will be updated because the master SVG has
#    changed.  The cache helps to avoid launching Inkscape for the unchanged
#    layers.
#
# 3. Serialize invocations of Inkscape.
#
#    This script runs Inkscape with `flock` such that we don't have multiple
#    instances of Inkscape starting at the same time (which we would get
#    with "make -j" if this script didn't block it).  Inkscape starting in
#    parallel often result in errors like this:
#
#      terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Gio::DBus::Error'
#
#    By the way, Inkscape running in parallel (as opposed to starting)
#    appears to work fine, keeping an interactive session of Inkscape open
#    while running `make` have not caused any trouble.  Or perhaps it works
#    because Inkscape was idle while `make` is running, who knows.  Your
#    safest bet is to always close all instances of Inkscape before running
#    this script.

# Path to Inkscape.  This is the Windows version of Inkscape and not the
# version that is distributed with Cygwin, even though all other scripts
# here expect Cygwin.
#
# We need at least version 1.4 to enable "--export-png-antialias" flag.
# https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/merge_requests/5167
#
# The same merge request above also added "--export-png-compression".
# The default is 6, which appears to encode at the same speed as 0 (and
# significantly faster than 9), so we kept the default.

# be referenced.  We could check all xlink:href attributes and see if they
# reference any external files, but since we only use so few of those, we
# will just manually invalidate all caches whenever we change those files.
